# Definitions

### Abstraction
Abstracion is hiding more complex details from the user and presenting it with a more simple
interface, making it easier to use and understand.

### Attributes / Properties
Attributes describe the objects that are defined in a class. A Node is an example of an 
attribute of a list based object.

### Class
A class is created by the user and uses variables and functions to define an object.

### Class Variable
A class variable is used to define a certain attribute of a class. A class that defines a person would have class 
variables such as name, weight, height, age, gender, etc.

### Composition
Composition is a way of combining objects of classes thereby making them more complex and is used when
classes or objects are different but similar to one another.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is combining fuctions and data members in a class and hiding them from the user
so that a user does not have direct access to them.

### Friends
A friend function is a function that is defined outside of a class but is a "friend" of  
that class and gains access to private functions and variables of that class.

### Inheritance
Inheritance is when a class inherits methods and attributes from its parent class thereby gaining 
access to all of the inherited methods.

### Instance Variable
A variable in a class that each object of the class has a different copy or instance of.

### Member Variable
A variable that has a specific object and can be accessed by all methods in the class.

### Method
Defined in a class it is part of an object that is used to allow that object to perform an action which 
then returns a value or changes that object in some way.

### Multiple Inheritance
This is when a class or object can inherit features from multiple differnt parent classes.

### Object
An object is an instance of a class that is defined by the programmer.

### Overloading
Overloading used to give an operator multiple meanings besides the default
meaning which makes it easier for the programmer.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism means that a call to a member function will cause a different function to be executed
depending on the type of object that invokes the function.

### Public / Private / Protected
Allows differnt levels of access to a user created object. Used as differnt types of security for a class.

### Virtual
A virtual function is defined in a parent class and then redefined in an inherited class.
